raptor-emergency-shutdownd — Raptor Security's Emergency Shutdown Manager.

Spec section 10. Deliberately a SEPARATE component from Mode Manager
(spec section 27 lists them as distinct modules) — mode changes and
"destroy this session and power off" are different enough in blast radius
that they shouldn't share a D-Bus method surface or a code path where a
bug in one can plausibly trigger the other.

    Bus name:    org.raptor.EmergencyShutdown
    Object path: /org/raptor/EmergencyShutdown
    Interface:   org.raptor.EmergencyShutdown1

Methods:
    GetPersistenceInfo() -> a{sv}
        Lets the GUI show an accurate "here's what will/won't be
        preserved" statement BEFORE asking for confirmation — spec
        section 10: "The UI should explain exactly what is being cleared."
    TriggerEmergencyShutdown(s live_user, b confirmed) -> b accepted
        `confirmed` must be explicitly True. This is a safety rail against
        a caller invoking the method without meaning to — it is NOT a
        substitute for the GUI's own confirmation dialog with Cancel /
        Shut Down & Clear Session buttons (spec section 10). Any caller
        that sets confirmed=True without having actually shown the user
        that dialog is misusing this API, not something this daemon can
        detect from the D-Bus call alone.

This process does not know how to "undo" — by design there is no
CancelShutdown() method once TriggerEmergencyShutdown has been called,
because past the confirmation dialog, spec section 10's flow is one-way.
The confirmation step is what CAN be cancelled, and that happens entirely
client-side in the GUI before this method is ever called.
